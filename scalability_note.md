# Short Scalability Note

- **Microservices**: Split auth, tasks, and user management into separate services with their own databases and APIs.
- **API Gateway & Load Balancer**: Use an API gateway and load balancer (NGINX/ALB) to route and scale services.
- **Database**: For high read throughput, add read replicas. Use partitioning/sharding for large datasets.
- **Caching**: Add Redis for session caching, rate-limiting, and frequent-read caching (tasks list).
- **Observability**: Centralized logging (ELK), tracing (Jaeger), and metrics (Prometheus + Grafana).
- **CI/CD & Containerization**: Docker + Kubernetes for orchestration, automated CI/CD for testing and deployment.
